                <p>Oh my god, my website is finally open again after, like, more than a year… Now on GitHub Pages instead of Neocities because I wanted to use a custom URL for free! I worked really hard on this rendition of the website. It took me like nine days compared to the last one I released publicly, which only took me like one. I have since learned a lot more about CSS and now know Bootstrap! So this website is 1, a lot prettier, and 2, mobile friendly! Also, I made sure to actually release it in a state I would consider finished and fun, unlike the first one, where it was just nothing… Like hey, you can check out the works tab. It has a showcase of all my illustrations since July 2023 and multiple archives! (Hosted on <a href="http://archive.envenuslu.com">archive.envenuslu.com</a>) Though I will be putting together the digital art archives at a later date! Also expect more from this blog soon… I will be using it quite a bit…</p>
