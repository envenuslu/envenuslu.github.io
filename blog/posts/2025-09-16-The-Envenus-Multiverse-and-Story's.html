      <p><span class="blodest">The Core Universe (?)</span><br>
          It starts with a girl called Encool. She's not a typical teenage girl, but there's something special about her… (Other than that, she’s rad as hell.) It's that she has multiple tiny universes in her head! literally… But she’s unaware of it. You can read about many of these universes below. </p>
      <p><span class="blodest">Mission FO Candy (Individual Story)</span><br>
            Mission FO Candy is a story about a witch-human scientist named Eleanor attempting to make a familiar despite her awfully weak magic strength until unexpectedly one of her attempts ends up being a success despite this lack of magical strength. Though the familiar displayed unusual behaviour. Instead of being obedient, the familiar is hyperactive and candy obsessed so Eleanor goes on a quest for research, lying to her new companion that it’s a “mission for candy.”</p>
      <p><span class="blodest">Welcome to the Solar System! (Project) </span><br>
          Welcome to the Solar System is a project about personified celestial objects in our solar system. The solar system is this kingdom that the Sun created, divided into 5 distinct regions overseen by the planets of each area. The Core is overseen by the Sun and Mercury, the Inner Town is overseen by Venus, Earth, and Mars, the Asteroid Belt is overseen by Jupiter, and the Main Town is overseen by Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, and Neptune also oversees the Kuiper Belt.</p>
      <p><span class="blodest">Isles In Stars (Individual Story)</span><br>
          This one will be the one I’m most vague about because I kind of don’t want to share a lot of it…
          It’s a story about an honours student named Albert who starts encountering seemingly supernatural beings, later finding out that they’re part of an incomprehensibly large reality bending light heading towards Earth.
            </p>
          <p>Ones I have less to say about.</p>
      <p><span class="blodest">Earth to (Individual Story)</span><br>
          A story about an alien who finds the Earth falling in love with it, only spending time with it, obsessing over it…</p>
          <p><span class="blodest">Unnamed Element thing (Project Duh)</span><br>
          It is this world, but there are supernatural beings who embody elements…</p>
